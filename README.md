# Car Garage Management using GoFr
Building a simple HTTP (REST) API using GoFr for performing CRUD operation.


### Introduction

This project is built using Golang, Gofr and MongoDB. It provides a RESTful API for managing car inventory. Users can perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting car records. The application also allows users to retrieve a list of all cars or filter cars based on criteria such as make, model, or year. The car data is stored in a MongoDB database. The project includes unit tests for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the application. 


### How to start the project?

To run this code in visual studio code you have to write "go run main.go" the server will automatically start. Since I have also done the unit testing ,to test this write "go test main_test.go".
Postman collection for trying out apis is present in Postman_collection.json file.
